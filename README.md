# Predicting-Happiness

• In this study, we are looking to create a model to predict Happiness. We have variables Household,
Health, OwnHome, Instagram, Marital, Sex, Age, Children, Education, JobSat, Income, and WorkHrs.
By finding a viable model, we could be able to use it for increasing happiness in a variety of fields and
applications from academic settings to social welfare.

• Steps taken:
1. Clean Data
2. Develop Full model without visibly unusable predictors (with abundant NAs)
3. Transform predictors using power transformation and inverse response plots
4. Remove Insignificant Variables using partial F-Tests, AIC, AICc, and BIC
5. Test interaction terms and include significant ones
6. Leverages, Outliers, and Influential Points
7. Final Model
