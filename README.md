# Predicting-Happiness

• In this study, we are looking to create a model to predict Happiness. We have variables Household,
Health, OwnHome, Instagram, Marital, Sex, Age, Children, Education, JobSat, Income, and WorkHrs.
By finding a viable model, we could be able to use it for increasing happiness in a variety of fields and
applications from academic settings to social welfare.

• We will first clean the data, take a high-level look at it, transform our predictors, and then remove
insignificant variables. We expect to encounter problems with the data along the way, as this is a social
sciences data set, and observations are not being dialed in by a computer and could be susceptible to
human error.
